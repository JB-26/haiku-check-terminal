# Haiku Check for Terminal

This is a terminal based application written in Python that allows a user to check if their haiku, is actually a haiku!

A simple program that uses the following packages:
- [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) to make the application look nice.
- [Syllables](https://pypi.org/project/syllables/) to count the syllables in each word

You will need a python environment running version 3.8.15 to run this application.

This application assumes your haikus are:
- three lines
- The first line has five syllables
- The second line has seven syllables
- The third line has five syllables

(This follows the 5-7-5 way of haikus)
